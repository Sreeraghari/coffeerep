            <h2>Discovery of the coffee bean <br> Origin in Kaffa</h2>
            <p>
                Numerous tales tell the story of the discovery of the very first coffee<br> bean and it´s very uniquely
                invigorating effect. According to <br> a story written down in 1671, coffee was first discovered by the
                <br>9th-century Ethiopian goat-herder Kaldi. While roaming the <br>countryside of the Ethiopian kingdom
                Kaffa with his goats,<br> he noticed, that his goats started behaving erratically when eating<br> the
                fruits of a mid-sized, dark green shrubbery with yellow <br>and red berries.
                <br><br>
                Following his curiosity, he took some of those stimulating “magic berries”<br> with him to the next
                monastery to have its effects explained <br>to him by the chaplain. Declaring it a devilish temptation,
                the <br>chaplain furiously tossed the berries into the fire. Shortly after,<br> the unique and aromatic
                smell of roasted coffee rose<br> from the fire, beguiling the monks. They quickly saved the beans from
                <br>the fire and, sooner or later, brewed the very first coffee.<br><br>
